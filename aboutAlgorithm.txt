Welcome to SharkTooth investing! We are an investing platform that gives unique benefits to
our investors. From the user experience, SharkTooth is entirely hands-off. This means
that while the investor can regularly check the status of their portfolio and their historical 
returns, they need not make any decisions about which equities their money is invested in. 
SharkTooth is powered entirely by an underlying algorithm that automates this process. So how does 
this algorithm work? 

SharkTooth's proprietary trading algorithm pulls daily closing prices of the NASDAQ 100. With this,
our algorithm analyzes the strength of each stock as well as the expectation we have for the stock 
to increase in price in the short term. The algorithm then contructs a personalized portfolio for 
each user based on that user's selected risk tolerance level. While low risk models are more diversified,
higher risk models invest only in the equities that the algorithm indicates as high growth.  

So sign up today, choose your model, and watch your portfolio grow!
